# Project Showcase Homepage

This is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project to showcase your projects in a clean and modern way.

## Features

*   **Clean, minimalist design:** A visually appealing layout to present your work.
*   **Responsive layout:** Optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
*   **Search bar:** Allows users to quickly find projects by name or description.
*   **Filters:** Categorize projects by technology (JavaScript, Python, PHP).
*   **Dark/Light Mode:** Toggle between light and dark themes for user preference.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd project-homepage
    ```

2.  **Open `index.html` in your browser:**

    Simply double-click the `index.html` file or serve it using a local web server (e.g., using Python: `python -m http.server`).

## Customization

1.  **Update Project Data:**  Modify the `projects` array in `script.js` to include your own projects.  Make sure to update the `name`, `description`, `tags`, `githubLink`, `demoLink`, and `image` properties for each project.  The image paths should be relative to your project's `index.html` file.

    ```javascript
    const projects = [
        {
            name: 'My Awesome Project',
            description: 'A brief description of my project.',
            tags: ['javascript', 'html', 'css'],
            githubLink: 'https://github.com/yourusername/your-project',
            demoLink: 'https://yourusername.github.io/your-project',
            image: 'assets/placeholder.png' // Use a relevant image for your project
        },
        // ... more projects
    ];
    ```

2.  **Replace Placeholder Images:** Add your own project thumbnails to the `assets` folder and update the `image` paths in `script.js` accordingly.

3.  **Customize Styling:** Modify the `styles.css` file to change the colors, fonts, and layout to match your personal style.  Feel free to use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for quicker styling.

4.  **Update Footer:**  Change the copyright information in the `footer` section of `index.html`.

## Deployment

This project is designed to be easily deployed to platforms like GitHub Pages.

1.  **Create a GitHub repository:**  Create a new repository on GitHub.

2.  **Push your code:**  Push the contents of your `project-homepage` directory to your GitHub repository.\

## Notes

*   Make sure the image paths in `script.js` are correct relative to your `index.html` file.
*   The `tags` property in the project objects in `script.js` is used for filtering.  Use relevant tags for your projects.
*   Feel free to expand on this project by adding more features, such as an "About Me" section, a contact form, or a blog.
